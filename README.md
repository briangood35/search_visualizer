# Search Visualizer
### This repository contains a visualization tool for breadth-first and depth-first searching algorithms.

To run visualization, run `python main.py`. The visualization will search starting from the top-left green square, and finish at the bottom-right green square. First, use the mouse to draw "walls" on the grid that the search is not allowed to go through.<br>

Then click either the BFS button to run a breadth-first search or the DFS button to run a depth-first search.<br>

Red tiles indicate that the tile has been searched, blue tiles are the tiles along the path the search algorithm found from the start tile to the end tile.
